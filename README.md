The film is a typical masala entertainer with a mix of comedy, romance, action, and sentiment. Ajith Kumar delivers a powerful performance as the dual-faced Ganesh, who can switch from being a loving brother to a ruthless killer in seconds. He also showcases his dancing skills in the chartbuster song "Aaluma Doluma", composed by Anirudh Ravichander. Shruti Haasan plays the feisty Swetha, who has a love-hate relationship with Ganesh. Lakshmi Menon impresses as the innocent Tamizh, who is unaware of her brother's secrets. Soori provides comic relief as the loyal Kaali, who often gets into trouble with Ganesh.
     
The film's action sequences are well-choreographed and executed, especially the climax fight on a boatyard. The film also has some emotional moments, such as the flashback scene where Ganesh reveals his true identity to Tamizh and the scene where he confronts Abhinay for killing his parents. The film's cinematography by Vetri and editing by Ruben are slick and stylish, giving the film a glossy look.
     
Vedalam is a film that caters to the fans of Ajith Kumar and the mass audience, who enjoy watching a hero-centric film with all the commercial elements. The film does not offer anything new or innovative in terms of story or screenplay, but it entertains with its fast-paced narration and Ajith's charisma.
